![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilentFlyBy/Blobby-Volley-2-Switch/master/icon.png)

This is a port of the [popular Volleyball game](http://http://blobby.sourceforge.net/) you all know from the good old LAN-party days. This is still in heavy WIP, so expect some features to be broken.

**What works:**
+ Local play with 2 full controllers ("full" means no "single-mode" Joycons)
+ Bots and custom bot scripts
+ Ruleset scripts
